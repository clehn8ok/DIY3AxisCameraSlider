This project is based on isaac879's slider. I incorporated the pan & tilt mechanism from him.
The brain is a esp32 uC with bluetooth, which is controlled via a generic PS3 Controller.
You can set keyframes via square button, and let the slider autonomously circle between the positions. You can also change the speed via L1&R1 to shoot timelapses.
total cost for the slider was about ~100â‚¬

Libraries used:

-FastAccelStepper

-PS3 Controller Host

don't h8 on me, for the coding, i am a noob :D
